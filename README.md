Hi! This is a project I finished in October 3rd, 2024. 

I have made this for a undergraduate research project at USP in the area of optimization.

When using any AUTORUN file, you can just run the project and it will create the outputs, each of them in a /output/ folder with NAMEOFFILE.tex.

When using any withou autorun files, you have to manually put the /input/NAMEOFFILE.txt to run it, running individually any .txt input file.

Hope you like it!
